### Hi there, I'm Melan ðŸ‘‹


## I'm a computer programmer :computer:

I've had the opportunity to work on numerous exciting and challenging projects throughout my career, many of which I cannot publicly disclose due to confidentiality agreements and proprietary constraints. However, these experiences have allowed me to deepen my expertise in various fields and refine my problem-solving and technical skills across a wide range of programming environments.

Outside of work, my focus is primarily on exploring various BSD operating systems and ensuring application portability across processor architectures beyond the familiar x86 and ARM. I have a particular interest in PowerPC (PPC) architecture, which I've had the opportunity to work with thanks to its use in some game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii and WiiU. These platforms provided me with a unique chance to dive into PPC programming, writing software for both Linux and NetBSD on PPC hardware. This exploration of alternative architectures has broadened my understanding of system design and performance optimization in diverse environments.

Beyond my work as a programmer, I am deeply passionate about electronics, network engineering, and embedded systems. I spend much of my personal time experimenting with hardware design, building custom electronic systems, and exploring ways to optimize network infrastructure. My interest in embedded systems, in particular, drives me to integrate software and hardware, creating efficient and tailored solutions for unique applications.

Since 2019, I operated an IPv6 network under [AS208755](https://bgp.he.net/AS208755), which initially ran on Quagga before I transitioned to FRRouting. However, as of September 2024, this network is no longer active due to a combination of infrastructure failure and RIPE NCC's mandatory fees on ASNs. I'm now considering a fresh start with a new ASN, looking forward to rebuilding and enhancing my network infrastructure.

It is important to note that these projects are my personal initiatives, entirely independent of my professional obligations, and are neither endorsed by nor affiliated with my employers.
