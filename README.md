### Hi there, I'm Melan 👋


## I'm a computer programmer :computer:

I've had the opportunity to work on numerous exciting and challenging projects throughout my career, many of which I cannot publicly disclose due to confidentiality agreements and proprietary constraints. However, these experiences have allowed me to deepen my expertise in various fields and refine my problem-solving and technical skills across a wide range of programming environments.

Outside of work, I primarily focus on C programming and exploring different processor architectures beyond the familiar x86 and ARM. I have a strong interest in working with systems that pose unique challenges, such as those with limited memory or heterogeneous CPU architectures. My experience with PowerPC includes writing software for Linux and *BSD on platforms like the PlayStation 3, Wii, and WiiU. The PlayStation 3, in particular, introduced me to SPU programming on the Cell Broadband Engine, which further deepened my understanding of parallel computing and low-level optimization. I enjoy pushing the limits of these architectures, developing applications that efficiently operate under constrained environments.

Beyond my work as a programmer, I am deeply passionate about electronics, network engineering, and embedded systems. I spend much of my personal time experimenting with hardware design, building custom electronic systems, and exploring ways to optimize network infrastructure. My interest in embedded systems, in particular, drives me to integrate software and hardware, creating efficient and tailored solutions for unique applications.

It is important to note that these projects are my personal initiatives, entirely independent of my professional obligations, and are neither endorsed by nor affiliated with my employers.
