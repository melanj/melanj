### Hi there, I'm Melan ðŸ‘‹


## I'm a computer programmer :computer:

I've worked on several interesting projects over the years, unfortunately I cannot list most of my work here

Apart from work as a programmer, I am very interested in electronics, network engineering and embedded systems 

I operate an IPv6 network [AS208755](https://bgp.he.net/AS208755) since 2019. It is now running with FRRouting but I started with Quagga
